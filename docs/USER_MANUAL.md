10. Troubleshooting
Problem	Likely Cause	Solution
Schedule generation fails	Not enough available faculty/rooms	Adjust availability, add more resources
Faculty assigned to multiple defenses at same time	Incorrect availability or overlapping slots	Verify availability in Faculty Editor
GUI doesn't start	Python/Tkinter not installed	Install Tkinter (pip install tk) or check Python installation
0 tests collected when running pytest	Wrong folder or file naming	Run from repo root; ensure files start with test_ and are inside tests/
ImportError: No module named src...	Python path not set	Run tests from repo root so src/ is importable
Availability/overlap tests fail	Logic mismatch in Person.is_available_at or TimeSlot.overlaps_with	Ensure unavailable_slots is used correctly and overlap logic is symmetric
Tkinter errors during tests	GUI code got imported in tests	Keep GUI bootstrapping in main.py only; do not instantiate Tk in tests
